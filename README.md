# neural-network
**Software for recognizing handwritten digits.**

The software will accept as input an image of a digit between 0 and 9 and return as output the digit that was identified. This will be done by building a model of a neural network. In order to implement the model itself, useful classes were implemented such as Matrix, network layer and activation function.

_The network will reach an accuracy of 96 percent in identification digits._
